# What is a Progressive Web App ? 

A Progressive Web App is a web app that delivers an app-like experience to users by using modern web capabilities. In the end, it's just your regular website that runs in a browser with some enhancements. It gives you the ability:

- To install it on a mobile home screen
- To access it when offline
- To access the camera
- To get push notifications
- To do background synchronization

And so much more.

However, to be able to transform our traditional web app to a PWA, we have to adjust it a little bit by adding a web app manifest file and a service worker.
